 * The Deck class represents a deck of cards used in the game.
 * It contains a list of Card objects, and the deck is initialized with all combinations of card values and suits.
 * The deck can be shuffled, and players can draw cards from it during the game.
 * The deck will contain 40 cards (since CardValue ranges from 1 to 10, and there are 4 suits).
